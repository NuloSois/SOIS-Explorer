## WHAT Is SOIS Explorer

SOIS Explorer is a Command-Line C# Program for File and Folder Management designed for Windows, it is intended to be easily acessible and usable by its accessible Command-Line interface, using keywords like `create` instead of unabstracted bullshit like `mkdir` so it can be used from the get-go. Sois Explorer also sets for acomplishing some things that your Windows Explorer cannot do, like identifying if a to-be-created file/folder is a file or a folder automatically (To be released in 1.2.0) and other nice features).

## WHY should I use SOIS Explorer

- It has Intuitive and Abstracted Commands so the user doesn't have to learn secret keywords, so you can use without reading any docs.
- It's super light and probably will not have to be repaired unless you do shit.
- Forkable and Maintanable, code is somewhat organized for that purpose.
- Can get file properties in bulk (all the properties of all files on a folder), something Windows Explorer cannot do.
- Is being actively developed.
